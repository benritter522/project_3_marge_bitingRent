        `
            I was afraid to listen to The Wall.
            I'll never learn not to fear just one small phone call.
            But luckily, I have learned to see some, not all,
            Of those things, recessed in my consciousness,
            Stored behind memories and drywall.

            I won't pretend.
            I can't break, I can't bend
            All those times that I let fall through my fingers.
            They've broken down into tiny sands
            Beneath my feet.

            Will you... Will you will me
            To reside just inside of your heart
            While I sleep for a while?

            It feels better when you sleep a little
            Than the times you weep a little
            Over those deranged times you couldn't change.
            Just know you're not alone.
            You don't have to fight those demons
            With sticks and stones.

            It's getting harder, harder
            To water those seeds that I planted.
            It was so romantic in my head.
            Why does it always go wrong?

            I was afraid to listen to The Wall.
            I'll never learn not to fear just one small phone call.       
            But maybe, I will learn to 
            Land on my feet when I fall.

        lyrics: 
        `
            Every night, I wake up to the sins
            Of every man that I have ever been.
            Every night I'm spent--
            Think of lost loves, wonder where they went.

            And I don't think we're gonna be alright.
            Take another sip, wash it down
            With all your jealousy.
            Inside, I feel I'm buring right...
            Burning right to the ground.
            I'll take what's left of me, but

            I can't look past this,
            Feel so tragically inclined
            To lie down in the face of 
            Overwhelming turning tides.
